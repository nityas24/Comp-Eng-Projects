Project 1: This project is a mini-mp3 player prototype, 
which uses a buzzer to play a song (Ode To Joy), 
a button, a potentiometer to control the volume, 
an LCD screen to display instructions, and uses a 
serial monitor to collect a response from the user! 

Project 2: This project is a prototype of a cat toy, 
which uses an ultrasonic senser to track the distance of a cat. 
When it is within a certain range, the servo begins spinning, which 
allows the cat to play with the toy, being a string which is attached to the servo. 

Project 3: This project allows the robot to travel through a maze, 
through the use of bumpers attached to the front of the robot. When the 
bumpers touch a surface, the aluminum allows the circuit to become complete, 
which turns the robot depending on which bumper was pressed. 

Project 4: This project simulates a real-life two way cross walk/intersection, 
where a pedestrian must press a button to change the green light to a red light 
to allow them to cross. Similarly, another button is used for the opposite pedestrian.
